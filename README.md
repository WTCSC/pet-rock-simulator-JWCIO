# Pet Rock Simulator

Ever wanted a pet that doesn’t bark, meow, or need walks?
Welcome to Pet Rock Simulator, where your only job is to care for (or torment) your digital rock.

# How to Play
Run the game and type commands to interact with your pet rock.
Each command changes its stats—hunger, happiness, cleanliness, health, anger, and more.

Examples of basic commands:

* feed – Give your rock something to munch on.

* play – Spend quality time together.

* clean – Because shiny rocks are happy rocks.

* rest – Let your rock nap.

* check stats – See how your rock is doing.
# Easter Eggs
This game hides a *LOT* of secret commands. Some are harmless, some are… dramatic.
Try typing things you wouldn’t expect to work. You might summon a wizard, cast a forbidden spell, or even nuke your poor rock.

Examples of surprises (no full spoilers):

Summon dark lords or wise wizards.

Run unexpected programs on your rock.

Use magic words from famous books.

Discover a way to change your rock’s very essence.

Or just… hug it.
